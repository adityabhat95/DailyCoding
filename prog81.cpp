/*
Problem : Given a mapping of digits to letters (as in a phone number), and a digit string, 
		  return all possible letters the number could represent. You can assume each valid
		  number in the mapping is a single digit.
		  For ex : {“2”: [“a”, “b”, “c”], 3: [“d”, “e”, “f”], …} then “23” 
		  should return [“ad”, “ae”, “af”, “bd”, “be”, “bf”, “cd”, “ce”, “cf"]
		  
Solution : Find the combination of each digit to letter mapping and solve it
